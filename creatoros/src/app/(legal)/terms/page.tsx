      <LegalSection heading="6. Third-party services">
        <p>
          The service relies on third parties such as Cashfree (payments) and Brevo (transactional email),
          and may rely on other providers for hosting and delivery. Their terms and privacy policies may
          also apply. We are not responsible for the acts or omissions of third-party services.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="7. Availability and changes to the service">
        <p>
          We work to keep the service available but we do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free
          operation. We may add, change or remove features, and may perform maintenance. Where a change
          materially affects a paid plan we will give reasonable notice.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="8. Disclaimers and liability">
        <p>
          The service is provided &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot;, without warranties of
          any kind to the maximum extent permitted by law. To the maximum extent permitted by law, our
          total liability arising out of or relating to the service is limited to the greater of the amount
          you paid us in the 12 months before the claim or USD 100. We are not liable for indirect,
          incidental, special or consequential loss, or for loss of profits, revenue, data or goodwill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms limits any liability that cannot lawfully be limited, including for
          fraud, or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence. Mandatory consumer rights in
          your country of residence are not affected.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="9. Suspension and termination">
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, if required by law, or if
          your use poses a risk to us or others. You may stop using the service and delete your account at
          any time. On termination your right to use the service ends; sections that by their nature should
          survive (such as liability, ownership and governing law) will survive.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="10. Governing law and disputes">
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of {LEGAL_INFO.governingLaw}, and the courts of that
          jurisdiction have exclusive jurisdiction, subject to any mandatory consumer-protection rules that
          give you the right to bring proceedings in your country of residence.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection heading="11. Changes to these Terms">
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. If a change is material we will notify you before it
          takes effect. Continuing to use the service after a change takes effect means you accept the
          updated Terms.
